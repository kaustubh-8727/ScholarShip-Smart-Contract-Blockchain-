# Scholarship Smart Contract

This project implements a decentralized scholarship approval system using Solidity and React. It allows department heads, such as HODs and professors, to vote on student scholarship applications based on academic performance. The student who receives the highest number of approvals will be awarded the scholarship.

## Key Features:
- **Decentralized Voting:** Department heads and professors can cast votes to approve or reject a student's scholarship application based on their academic achievements.
- **Fair Selection:** The student with the most votes is automatically selected for the scholarship, ensuring a transparent and fair process.
- **Smart Contract Implementation:** The voting process and scholarship allocation are managed by a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring security and immutability.
- **React Frontend:** A user-friendly interface built with React allows users to interact with the smart contract, view student applications, and cast votes.

## Technologies Used:
- **Solidity:** Smart contract development.
- **React:** Frontend development.
- **Ethereum:** Blockchain platform for deploying the smart contract.

## How It Works:
1. Department heads and professors log in to the application.
2. They can view the list of students who have applied for the scholarship.
3. Based on the students' academic performance, they cast their votes.
4. The smart contract tallies the votes, and the student with the most votes is awarded the scholarship.

This system ensures a transparent, decentralized, and fair process for awarding scholarships based on merit.
